Released into the public domain

This implements a chunked server using Python threads and the built-in
BaseHTTPServer module. Enable gzip compression at your own peril - web
browsers seem to have issues, though wget, curl, Python's urllib2, my own
async_http library, and other command-line tools have no problems.

    This is just a proof of concept server that uses threads. You can make it
    fork, maybe hack up a worker thread model, or even use multiprocessing.
    That's your business. But as-is, it works reasonably well for streaming
    chunked data from a server.

    This little bit of code is meant to act as a buffer between the optional
    gzip writer and the actual outgoing socket - letting us properly construct
    the chunked output. It also lets us quickly and easily determine whether
    we need to flush gzip in the case where a user has specified
    'ALWAYS_SEND_SOME'.

    This offers a minimal interface necessary to back a writing gzip stream.

    Nothing is terribly magical about this code, the only thing that you need

    Gzip compression works partially. See the module notes for more
